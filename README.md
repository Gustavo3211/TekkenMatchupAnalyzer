# Tekken Matchup Analyzer

This is a simple web application built with Python and Eel to analyze matchups in the game Tekken. It fetches data from player profiles on the [Wavu Wank](https://wank.wavu.wiki) website and provides insights into win/loss records against different characters.

## How to Use without using the builds compiled by me:
(i would reccomend cuz i have no idea how to compile python scripts to exe)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main.py script using Python.
5. Open your web browser.
6. Enter the profile link of a Tekken player from the Wavu Wank website.
7. Click the "Search" button to fetch and display matchup data.
